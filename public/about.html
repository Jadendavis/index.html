<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>In my free time I enjoy coding, map making, and reading. Recently I have been doing alot of map making for 
  Quake 2, an old retro shooter. As for coding, I have been taking Angela's bootcamp course on Udemy, along with a few others.
  When it comes to reading I enjoy quite alot of different things, but most of them are nonfiction. Some of these being the Gulag Archipalego, Walden, World War 2 Pacific Theatre.
