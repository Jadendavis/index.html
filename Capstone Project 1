        <h1>Summary </h1>
        <p>This resume will be built using everything I have learned so far, and will be show casing how far I can push that knowledge.
        </p>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> I went to trade school to be an electrician.</li>
                <li>G.E.D</li> 
            <li>Taken many online courses, including some ue4/5 and html. I have also gotten fairly good with the program Trenchbroom, used to make in-game maps for games that 
            use the Quake engine.</li>
        </ul>    
        <h2> Work Experience </h2>
        <p> I did construction for almost a decade, everything from framing, roofing, drywall, electrical, flooring, siding. 
            I've ran a kitchen/tavern, for almost a year. It was there I first learned how to have good customer interactions, which I later applied to getiting jobs for the
            construction crew I worked for.
            I have 1.5 years of experience working in a factory, where I ran a line of machines that produced wheel hubs for various vehicles. We had an engineer that would come by
            if there was ever a problem, and I would basically shadow him to try and learn as much as I could about it. Much of it was out of my field of work, but I was still interested.
            I learned some of the different code that they used to run the machines, including a robot arm.
        </p>
        <h2> Skills </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I'm a very fast learner</li>
            <li> I can read/write blueprints for houses/garages/barns</li>
            <li> almost a decade of computer use that is far outside the scope of an average person.
            This includes map making, game development which I am still working on in my spare time as I don't know everything needed to finish the game. As it sits there are no maps
            but there is movement and a gun with animations coded in and functional. </li>
        </ul>
